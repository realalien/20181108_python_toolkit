## Purpose

To rendezvous all the python best practices and usage in one place for future development use, in order to reuse and eliminate the code copying all around.

All the listing serve as a reminder for behavior and code of conduct for python scripting.

## Listings

There are two categories of the scripts, modules are for import, scripts are for command line use.

### Modules





### Scripts

#### Automatic



#### Manual

* pep8 check  - `pycodestyle.sh [options] inputs`
* 





## Ideas and Notes

* 20181111:  using bash script is kind of tedious as calling scripts requiring knowing the exact locations of the script. Q: Is it possible to create a suite of tests for automation. e.g. for pep8, auto check and fix?
* 20181111: IDEA: if machine is intelligent enough, it should know about the different style of code smell and learn/generalize how human understand things.
